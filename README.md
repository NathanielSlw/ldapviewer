**ldapviewer** is a Python script to visualize **all** LDAP data from ldapdomaindump `.json` files in a modern, interactive web interface.  
Unlike the default `.html` files generated by ldapdomaindump, **ldapviewer** displays every LDAP attribute, ensuring you never miss critical information.

## Why?

I created this tool because:

1. **ldapdomaindump** and **Bloodhound** often miss some LDAP attributes in their output. For example, during several pentests, I missed sensitive data such as passwords stored in unexpected fields rather than the more common description field, because these tools didnâ€™t display them.
2. I wanted to avoid running additional `ldapsearch` queries for information I already had, and not struggle with LDAP query syntax.
3. I needed an easy way to filter and search LDAP data for fields that are useful during penetration testing.

## Usage

```sh
python ldapviewer.py <ldapdomaindump.json>
```

### Example

To visualize a domain users dump:
```sh
python ldapviewer.py domain_users.json
```
Then open the generated HTML file (`ldapviewer_domain_users.html`) in your browser.

## Features

**ldapviewer** lets you quickly and interactively explore the full content of an LDAP JSON dump:

- **Detail view**: See all attributes for each LDAP entry, nothing is hidden.
- **Table view**: All entries and all attributes as columns, for easy comparison.
- **Instant search**: Filter entries as you type.
- **CSV export**: Export the current table view to CSV.
- **Non-default object filtering**: Instantly hide/show default Windows objects (RID < 1000).
- **UAC filtering**: Filter users by UserAccountControl flags with one click.
- **Attribute-based filtering**: Filter entries by LDAP attributes (e.g., has SPN, msDS-AllowedToDelegateTo, has Description)
- **Modern responsive interface**: All HTML/CSS/JS is embedded and works offline.
- **Dark mode**: Switch between light and dark themes with automatic system preference detection.
